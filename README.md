# Personal Growth Application

![Personal Growth and Stress Management Web Application]()

Visit The Live Website: [Personal Growth and Stress Management Web Application](https://django-self-improvement-app.herokuapp.com/)

The Self Help App is a web application and software that was inspired and created to help people who might be too afraid to reach out for help and prefer to work on themselves, by themselves.

The user can create a profile and journal their entries and set some personal goals that they feel would help them to work on and develop their self-esteem and all-round mental health, the app was created with the point-of-view that seeing your own hard work can help you see the true capacity of your own strength.

In a world where social media and technology can be detrimental to our mental health, it's important to remember that the same technology can also help us look after ourselves
